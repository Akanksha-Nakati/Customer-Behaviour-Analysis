# Netflix Customer Behavior Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of Netflix's userbase data, focusing on customer behavior patterns, revenue generation, and user retention. This project leverages demographic and behavioral data to deliver actionable insights that can drive customer engagement, enhance retention, and inform strategic decision-making.

## Situation
Netflix, as a leading streaming platform, offers multiple subscription plans tailored to customer needs across the globe. Given the competitive landscape, understanding customer behavior is crucial for optimizing revenue and improving user experience. This project undertakes a detailed analysis of Netflix's userbase to identify the key factors driving subscription preferences, engagement, and churn. By examining age, gender, country, device type, and payment history, this analysis seeks to uncover trends that influence user retention and revenue growth.

## Task
The primary objective of this analysis is to examine customer behavior patterns that influence:
- **Revenue Generation**: Understanding how subscription type preferences impact revenue.
- **User Retention**: Identifying factors that contribute to longer customer tenure and reduce churn.
- **User Engagement**: Analyzing device usage and its effect on content consumption.

Key focus areas include:
1. Segmenting user preferences by subscription type (Basic, Standard, Premium).
2. Analyzing the impact of demographics (age, gender, and country) on revenue and retention.
3. Assessing device influence on user engagement.
4. Identifying churn risk through payment activity and subscription duration patterns.

## Action
To achieve the project goals, the analysis utilized the following fields from the dataset:
- **Subscription Type**: Categorized as Basic, Standard, and Premium to identify revenue and engagement patterns.
- **Monthly Revenue**: Revenue generated per user, based on subscription plan.
- **Join Date and Last Payment Date**: Used to calculate customer tenure and identify churn risk.
- **Country, Age, Gender, Device Type**: Key demographic and behavioral indicators.

### Key Actions Taken
- **Segmentation by Subscription Type**: Users were grouped by plan type to observe revenue contribution and preferences.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Cross-analysis of age, gender, and country to identify trends in subscription preferences.
- **Device Usage Analysis**: Assessed the impact of device type (Smartphone, Laptop, Smart TV) on user engagement and plan choice.

## Results
The analysis provided critical insights into customer behavior, contributing to actionable strategies for retention and revenue optimization:

### Revenue Generation
- **Premium Plans**: Higher revenue contribution, especially among middle-aged users (35-45).
- **Basic Plans**: Popular among younger users (under 30), particularly in the United States and Germany.

### User Retention and Behavior
- **Device Influence**: Users on Smart TVs and Laptops show longer tenures and higher engagement compared to smartphone users.
- **Geographic Trends**: Premium plans are most popular in the United States and Canada, while Germany has a higher proportion of Basic plan subscribers.

### Device Preferences
- **Smartphone Users**: Tend to opt for shorter-term, lower-tier plans (Basic).
- **Larger Screens (Smart TV)**: Customers using larger screen devices favor Premium or Standard plans, indicating a correlation between device type and spending.

## Recommendations
Based on these findings, Netflix can consider the following strategies:
1. **Incentives for Smartphone Users**: Offer upgrades or tailored content for smaller screens to encourage higher-tier plan adoption.
2. **Targeted Regional Campaigns**: Roll out marketing campaigns for Basic and Standard plans in regions where these plans are popular, such as Germany.
3. **Device-Specific Promotions**: Encourage larger screen consumption (e.g., Smart TVs) to boost user engagement and revenue.

## Conclusion
This customer behavior analysis offers actionable insights for Netflix to enhance user experience, tailor content to user preferences, and improve customer retention. By leveraging demographic, device, and engagement data, Netflix can optimize its offerings to meet the evolving needs of its diverse user base.
